# Football Match Result Predictor

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the outcomes of football matches (Win/Draw/Loss) by leveraging detailed individual player performance data. Using a comprehensive dataset of player statistics from the top 5 European leagues from 2012 to 2025, the goal is to engineer team-level features to train a robust classification model.
The final, validated model will be deployed via a simple API and mobile application to provide on-demand match predictions.

## Data Source
Source: Kaggle: Football Player Stats (2018-2023) (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidcariboo/player-scores)

Description: This dataset contains granular, player-level performance statistics for every match in the top 5 European leagues (England, Spain, Italy, Germany, and France) from the 2018-2019 season to the 2022-2023 season. Key features include goals, assists, shots, cards, and minutes played for each player in a given match.

## Project Workflow
1.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Correcting data types, handling missing values, and standardizing formats.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing the data to uncover initial trends, patterns, and insights.
3.  **Feature Engineering:** Creating new, predictive features from the existing data.
4.  **Modelling & Evaluation:** Training and testing a regression model to predict match outcomes.
5.  **Deployment:** Building a simple API and an Android app to serve the model's predictions.

## Tools & Libraries
* **Data Analysis:** Excel, SQL
* **Programming & Modeling:** Python
* **Python Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* **API (Optional):** Flask or FastAPI
* **App Development:** Android Studio (Java/Kotlin)

## Key Findings & Results
Summarize the most important insights from your EDA and the final performance of your model (e.g., accuracy, Mean Absolute Error, etc.).

## Future Improvements
List potential next steps (e.g., using more advanced models, incorporating more data sources, improving the app's UI).
